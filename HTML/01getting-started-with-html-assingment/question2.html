<!-- Q: Explain the purpose of comments in HTML and provide an example of how to use comments in an HTML document? -->

<!-- Ans:
Comments in HTML are used to insert a comment in the source code. It is not displayed on the web browser when the page is rendered but it is visible in the source code. This comment is used to help developers to understand the code and to help developers to edit the code in future if required. Also it can remove a section of code without deleting it. It is not visible to end user so it helps developers in documentation and debugging.
Comments are been created using ”< ! -- ” and “- ->” . Anything that is written between this gets treated as comment and is not visible while rendering the browser. -->
