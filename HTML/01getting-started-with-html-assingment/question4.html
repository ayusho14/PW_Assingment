<!-- Q: Write a short note on Tag and element with an example? -->

<!-- Ans: 

Tags are the fundamental building blocks of HTML. They are enclosed in angular  brackets (<>) and are used to define the structure of the content. Tags are used in pairs an opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag identifies the beginning of an element, while the closing tag signifies the end of that element. Closing tags are identical to opening tags except for the addition of a forward slash (/) before the tag name. Tags can also have attributes, which provide additional information or properties about the element.
Elements are created by enclosing content within a pair of tags, including the opening and closing tags. Elements consist of everything between the opening and closing tags, which can include text, other elements, or a combination of both. Elements represent different parts of a document's structure or content, such as headings. paragraphs, links, images, and more.  -->
