What is the DOCTYPE Declaration in HTML?


Ans: 

The DOCTYPE declaration, often referred to as just "DOCTYPE," is a critical element in an
HTML document. It serves to define the document type and version of HTML being used,
which helps web browsers and other parsers understand how to interpret and render the
content correctly. The DOCTYPE declaration appears at the very beginning of an HTML
document, typically before the <html> opening tag.
